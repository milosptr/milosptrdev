  "about": {
    "firstParagraph": "I‚Äôm <strong>Milo≈°</strong>, a 27 years old self-taught <strong>Full Stack developer</strong>, from Serbia <strong>residing</strong> in <strong>Reykjavik, Iceland</strong>.",
    "secondParagraph": "After high school, I began my career as a <strong>web developer</strong>, where I stayed for one year. During this time, I created over <strong>100 simple HTML and CSS websites</strong> based on provided designs and developed up to <strong>15 WordPress websites</strong>‚Äîsome with <strong>custom themes</strong> and others using purchased templates. After a year, I realized I was <strong>not progressing</strong> and <strong>needed new challenges to continue growing</strong>.",
    "thirdParagraph": "In <strong>March 2018</strong>, thanks to a former colleague, I secured a new job that allowed me to <strong>explore new technologies</strong>. I delved into the world of <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>PHP</strong>, learning a great deal by building a <strong>mobile web app</strong> in <strong>PHP</strong> and a website with a <strong>custom backend</strong>. However, after a year, the <strong>lack of new projects</strong> led me to feel stagnant once again.",
    "fourthParagraph": "Determined to advance my skills, I started studying <strong>ReactJS</strong> in my free time and <strong>fell in love with JavaScript and React</strong>. A colleague and I decided to build a <strong>flight booking engine</strong>, which led me to learn <strong>AngularJS</strong>. I built the entire booking system with online payment in <strong>AngularJS</strong> but later realized that <strong>ReactJS</strong> was a better fit for my interests, so I rebuilt the system using <strong>ReactJS</strong>.",
    "fifthParagraph": "In <strong>April 2019</strong>, I accepted a job offer that enabled me to focus on <strong>personal growth and development</strong>. During my time at this company, I evolved significantly as a developer, embracing the mindset of a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>. I immersed myself in various technologies such as <strong>Laravel</strong>, <strong>Vue.js</strong>, and <strong>NativeScript</strong> for app development.",
    "sixthParagraph": "In <strong>June 2022</strong>, I made the difficult decision to leave my position at <strong>Morph Networks</strong>, where I had been working since 2019. Grateful for the experiences and growth opportunities, I felt it was time for a new challenge and took some time to reflect on my next steps.",
    "seventhParagraph": "In <strong>October 2022</strong>, I relocated to <strong>Reykjavik, Iceland</strong>, embracing an exciting new chapter in my life. I started a new position at <strong>Sidekick Health</strong> as a <strong>Senior Web Developer</strong>, specializing in <strong>TypeScript</strong> and <strong>ReactJS</strong>. The move was both thrilling and daunting, but I was eager to grow both personally and professionally.",
    "eighthParagraph": "In <strong>2023</strong>, I took another significant step by enrolling in a <strong>Bachelor of Science</strong> program in <strong>Computer Science</strong> at <strong>Reykjavik University</strong>. Currently, in <strong>2024</strong>, I am in my <strong>second year</strong> (third semester), where I‚Äôve significantly enhanced my <strong>Python</strong> skills through various university projects that extensively use Python.",
    "ninthParagraph": "At work, I expanded my expertise by contributing to the backend using <strong>Java</strong> and writing end-to-end tests in <strong>Cypress</strong> to improve the quality of the portal we are developing. We transitioned from a <strong>RESTful API</strong> to <strong>GraphQL</strong>, further broadening my skill set. I also introduced the <strong>React Query</strong> library to our frontend stack, which drastically improved our software‚Äôs performance and reliability.",
    "tenthParagraph": "In <strong>2024</strong>, I embarked on an exciting project: developing an <strong>Android</strong> and <strong>iOS</strong> app from scratch for a <strong>trucking company</strong>. The app functions as a navigation tool, allowing users to track trucks, manage loads and unloads, view and add stops, handle border crossings, and input bills during shipments. Through this project, I honed my skills in <strong>React Native</strong>, adding mobile app development to my repertoire.",
    "eleventhParagraph": "My journey has been an incredible rollercoaster of learning and self-discovery. From a self-taught <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> in Serbia to a <strong>Senior Web Developer</strong> and <strong>Computer Science</strong> student in Iceland, I have continuously sought opportunities to grow and challenge myself. These experiences have shaped me both personally and professionally, and I‚Äôm excited to see where the future takes me."
