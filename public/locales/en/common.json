  "about": {
    "firstParagraph": "I‚Äôm <strong>Milo≈°</strong>, a 26 years old self-taught <strong>Full Stack developer</strong>, from Serbia <strong>residing</strong> in Reykjavik, Iceland.",
    "secondParagraph": "After high school, I got a job as a web developer, where I stayed 1 year. Within this year I've created over 100 simple HTML & CSS websites following given designs, developed up to 15 WordPress websites (few with custom themes and others were purchased). After 1 year working here I have realized that I‚Äôm <strong>stuck, sinking</strong> and <strong>not learning anything</strong> new.",
    "thirdParagraph": "In March 2018, my ex-colleague found me a new job at his firm where I could start going forward and learn some new technologies. I also stayed here 1 year and started exploring the JavaScript and PHP world. I have learned many things building a mobile web app in PHP and a website with a custom backend. Long story short, after that, there were no new projects and I was stuck again.",
    "fourthParagraph": "I decided it was <strong>time for a change</strong>, so I started studying ReactJS in my free time. I fell <strong> in love with JavaScript and React</strong>. Colleague and I got an idea to build a <strong>flight booking engine</strong>, so I started progressively learning Angular 1 and built the whole <strong>booking system with online payment</strong> in Angular 1. As I got better in JavaScript I figured that Angular 1 was a <strong>bad idea</strong>, so I switched again back to ReactJS and started rebuilding the whole system again.",
    "fifthParagraph": "I received a <strong>job offer</strong> in April 2019 that allowed me to <strong>focus on my personal growth and development</strong>, so I seized the opportunity. During my time at that company, I learned a tremendous amount and evolved as a developer. It was there that I truly embraced the mindset of a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>, diving into various technologies such as Laravel, VueJS, and NativeScript (app development).",
    "sixthParagraph": "In June 2022, I made the difficult decision to leave my job as a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> at Morph Networks, where I had been working since April 2019. I was grateful for the growth and opportunities I had experienced there, but I knew it was time for a new challenge. After taking some time to reflect and explore my options, I decided to make a bold move.",
    "seventhParagraph": "In October 2022, I relocated to <strong>Reykjavik, Iceland</strong>, leaving behind my familiar surroundings in Serbia. This was an exciting and somewhat daunting decision, but I was eager to embrace the adventure and grow both personally and professionally. I started a new position with <strong>Sidekick Health</strong> as a <strong>Senior Web Developer</strong>, specializing in <strong>TypeScript</strong> and <strong>ReactJS</strong>.",
    "eighthParagraph": "In conclusion, my journey so far has been an incredible rollercoaster of learning and self-discovery. I've transitioned from being a self-taught <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> in Serbia to a <strong>Senior Web Developer</strong> in the thriving digital health industry in Iceland. These experiences have shaped me as a person and a developer, and I'm excited to see where the future will take me."
